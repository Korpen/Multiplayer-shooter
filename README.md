# Multuplayer-shooter
Multiplayer shooter game with a top-down birds eye view and a catchy soundtrack.

Only works on firefox. You also need sound and graphics which can be found in this dropbox-folder:

Eventually there will be folders and all other kinds of fancy stuff but for now, what you see is what you get.
