# Multuplayer-shooter
Multiplayer shooter game with a top-down birds eye view and a catchy soundtrack.

Some features only work in firefox at the moment. 

You also need sound and graphics which can be found in this dropbox-folder:

Eventually there will be folders and all other kinds of fancy stuff but for now, what you see is what you get.
